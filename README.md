Game Description

Tournament of Champions (TOC) is a strategy game. The current prototype provides a very simplified version of the game for one player. Here is the briefing provided to a player of this version of the game: 

You are the ruler of the magical kingdom of Disc Earth. Rather than waging wars, every 4 years you and your enemies meet for a tournament where your respective champions engage in fighting challenges. The prizes are money rather than territory or lives. You must assemble an team of champions who can meet (and hopefully win) the challenges from your enemies. The game provides a collection of champions whom can join your team."

At the start of the game, you have a fixed amount of money (1000 gulden) in your treasury which can be used to assemble your team of champions for the tournament. To add a champion to your team, you have to use the money in your treasury to pay their tournament entry fee. Once you have a team, you will be expected to meet some challenges. Winning a challenge will bring you rewards, and increase your treasury. If you lose a challenge, you have to pay the reward money to your enemy and lose it from your treasury. At any point in the game, you can enter or withdraw champions from the tournament team. If you withdraw a champion, you get get back half of their tournament entry fee. So when you need money, you can withdraw champions (if they are in your team, but not if they are dead or already withdrawn. The skill in this version is in assembling your team in a way which enables you to win challenges and increase your treasury. 

Your enemies offer different types of challenges. Each challenge has a unique number, the name of the enemy, a type (Magic, Fight or Mystery), a required skill level, and a reward. In this game prototype, you will need to select a challenge by number (later versions will select challenges for you, at random). Your game should then choose the first available champion in your team who can meet the challenge and compare the skill levels.
